## Getting Started

### Requirements

_CYBERTEC Migrator demo_ is controlling a set of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images that are brought up by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [`CYBERTEC Migrator`](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator) (`>= 3.7.0`)
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (`>= 1.27.0`)
- `git` (`>= 2.20.1`)
- `bash` (`>= 4.0`)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Change directory into cloned repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator_demo
cd cybertec_migrator_demo
```

## Starting a demo database

The [CYBERTEC Migrator](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator) has to be up and running before starting a demo database.
The demo databases join into the existing `Docker` network created by the [`CYBERTEC Migrator`](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator).

```sh
./demo_env up {demo_db | oracle}
```

The `EXTERNAL_DEMO_POSTGRES_PORT` and `EXTERNAL_DEMO_ORACLE_PORT` variables in the `.env` file (generated by executing the `./demo-env` script) control the choice of port on which the demo databases are served.
